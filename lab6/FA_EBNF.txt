FA reads from a file the info in the following order line by line: Q, E, S, q0, F.
S has its own class which lets you get, add elements and get the resulting state of a state and an operation.
Function testFA, given an operations list, returns False if the operations are invalid or not a DFA. Otherwise it returns the final state.
